# Computer-Aided-Diagnosis-of-NAFLD-using-ML

### Objective: 
In this study we explore the role of machine learning and deep learning in improving
computer-aided diagnostic methods for Non-Alcoholic fatty liver disease. This study explores two
main non-invasive diagnostic methods, namely using predominantly laboratory bio-marker data
(NHANES 2017-18) and the b-mode ultrasound image dataset containing parasagittal liver-kidney
ultrasounds of 55 patients.

### Methods: 
For NHANES 2017-18 data we proposed a deep learning stacked ensemble model
containing 3-layer MLP, 5-layer MLP and Random Forest models. We individually compared the
modelsâ€™ performances and also illustrated the advantage of ensemble. For Ultrasound images data, we
automated the process of liver region extraction using a fine-tuned version of a pretrained transformer
model U-net.Furthermore, our proposed method involved extracting texture features from image
sequences and stacking them to serve as an auxiliary input to a CNN+Bi-LSTM model.

### Results: 
The stacked ensemble achieved the performance of a Recall of 0.997 ,Precision of 0.998 ,
accuracy of 99.8, AUC score of 0.997. The proposed method
Achieved 87% accuracy, recall 0.84, precision of 0.9, f1-score of 0.88 and specificity of 0.7.
